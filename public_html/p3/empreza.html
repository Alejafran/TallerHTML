                     Ice Cream "Sweet Cream" is a family business that has its origins in Carthage, Valle, Colombia in the last years of the 40's by a family of Pereirans, who thanks to the effort and daily work managed to produce ice cream whose quality lasts Until today. Our grandparents performed all the work, including the distribution and street vending, touring the streets with carts that were recognized by all. In 2014 a Sweet Cream ice cream shop is installed in the city of Pereira and branches in different places in the area. Our ice creams are made daily, using raw material of first quality, dried fruits, creams and chocolates, in totally handmade form that guarantees the freshness and flavor of the same ones. In the acutality we have 60 different tastes (which delight the big and small). We also offer light ice creams and a wide range of frozen desserts and cakes ..
